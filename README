Makefile Usage:

To build a Single Precision Executable, use "make single"
To build a Double Precision Executable, use "make double"


Code Usage:

./mm_cpu [MATRIX A INFILE] [MATRIX B INFILE]
Outputs matrix into file "result.out"


Notes on Code:

Valgrind returns several mem errors due to strtok, strlen, etc... As far as we know, we cannot correct these..
No memory errors come from mallocs in our code
